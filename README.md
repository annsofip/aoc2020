# Advent of Code 2020

## Groovy
I am trying to learn Groovy so all solutions are first coded in Groovy. These are written dirty and fast. I might have tried to clean some of them up.

There is a main method for each day and also simple tests written with spock.


## Javascript
Some days also have a javascript solution, usually coded using functional programming styles. These are written later in the day and are usually less dirty.
